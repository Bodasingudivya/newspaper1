    <p>
        <b>
            Lord Krishna is the Hindu god of love, compassion, and protection. Known as the Dark One, he is often
            depicted with dark blue skin. Krishna is an avatar of the god Vishnu, but he is also worshiped as a god in
            his own right. Hindu mythology is filled with tales about Krishna's life.

            When questioned about the different forms in which Shri Krishna may be worshipped, Param Pujya Dadashri
            recommended the worship of Bal Krishna statue to those who desire worldly benefit. To those desirous of
            moksha (liberation from the cycles of birth and death), He recommended worshipping the Self-knowledge
            expounded by Yogeshwara Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita.

            Param Pujya Dadashri further explained that, “When a person devotes himself to a murti (idol), he remains
            the idol - the formed non-self complex; when a person devotes himself to the Amurta (formless), he attains
            the formless Self and becomes liberated. Shree Krishna said, ‘You actually are Lord Krishna (the
            Paramatma).’ But how will this be understood unless you have attained the knowledge of the Self?”

            Param Pujya Dadashri concluded by saying, “You need the religion of Yogeshwar Krishna; it is a temple of
            Gnan (Self-knowledge). Lord Krishna was a Gnani (embodiment of Self-knowledge). He became enlightened. He
            became a Gnani Purush (Narayan) from an ordinary human being (nara).” Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur

            Radha and Krishna’s relationship on earth is marked by a long separation that is often attributed to a curse
            that befell on Radha before her incarnation. As the fable goes, Krishna and Radha are eternal lovers who
            were together long before they descended on earth.

            According to BrahmaVaivarta Purana, during their time in Goloka, Radha got into a heated argument with
            Krishna’s persona attendant Shridama. In a fit of rage, she cursed him to be reborn as a demon. In turn,
            Shridama cursed Radha to endure 100 years of separation from her eternal lover in her human form. It is
            believed that this curse was responsible for Radha spending much of her time on earth gripped by the pain of
            being separated from Krishna.


            Despite its ups and down and many turns and twists, Radha Krishna’s relationship not only survived its brief
            spell among us mere mortals but has lived on for centuries and continues to inspire millions even today.
            That in itself is a testament to the beauty and depth of their bond.Radha and Krishna’s relationship on
